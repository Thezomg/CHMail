Mail System Implemented in CommandHelper

Copy all files into any location under your LocalPackages directory (may we suggest LocalPackages/CHMail?).

This script requires version 3.3.1 or higher of CommandHelper.

commands:
	/mail: shows mail help
	/mail read: view the message index
	/mail read <id>: read a single message
	/mail send <user> <message>: send a message to a user
    /mail senditem <user> <item> [amount]: send an item to a user
	/mail clear: clear all messages
	/mail delete <id>: delete a specific message
