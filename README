    /mail: shows mail help
    /mail inbox [page]: view the message index
    /mail read <id[,id][,id-id]>: read a single message
    /mail send <user> <message>: send a message to a user
    /mail senditem <user> <item> [amount]: send an item to a user
    /mail accept <id>: accept an item the user received
    /mail clear: clear all messages
    /mail delete <id>: delete a specific message
