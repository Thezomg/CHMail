Mail System Implemented in CommandHelper

Copy all files into any location under your LocalPackages directory (may we suggest LocalPackages/CHMail?).

This script requires version 3.3.1 or higher of CommandHelper.

commands:
    /mail: shows mail help
    /mail read: view the message index
    /mail read <id>: read a single message
    /mail send <user> <message>: send a message to a user
    /mail senditem <user> <item> [amount]: send an item to a user
    /mail clear: clear all messages
    /mail delete <id>: delete a specific message
